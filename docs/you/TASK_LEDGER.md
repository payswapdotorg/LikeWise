Each wave is internally parallel. The TL can authorize a wave only when dependencies are satisfied.

## Current bootstrap dispatch

- Repository anchor SHA: `8e4c6cf489da92f1a602cccab2b8516f7247ea68`
- Bootstrap head at T0 execution: `5a787eeec9151d5a025e3852f95a898eac6f019a`
- YOU-000: GitHub issue #1 — **T0 EXECUTED** (see T0 record below)
- YOU-101: GitHub issue #2 — W1A MERGED (PR #6, merge 55e4dbd; worker commit 8a5959c)
- YOU-102: GitHub issue #3 — W1B MERGED (PR #7, merge 71269f4; worker commit cff66d4)
- YOU-103: GitHub issue #4 — W1C dispatched (branch `you/w1c-lab`), IN FLIGHT
- Status: W1 PARTIAL-MERGED (A+B landed + station-verified; C in flight; T1 completes on C)

## T0 — TL baseline and contract freeze (DONE)

Executed by the TL per issue #1 (YOU-000):

- T0.1 baseline/freshness audit: `node scripts/check-workspace-freshness.mjs`
  → baseline fresh, in sync with origin/main (ahead 0 / behind 0).
- T0.2 module context map: `docs/you/REPO_MAP.md` verified against the live
  tree (app-shell/v4 workbench authority, browser-use + artifact surfaces,
  platform abstraction, services layout) and adopted as the wave-1 module
  map.
- T0.3 contract freeze: `packages/shared/src/you/contract.ts` (frozen v1
  machine types, exported through the `@zcode/shared` public entry) +
  `docs/you/CONTRACTS.md` "Wave-1 contract freeze (v1)" section. Covers
  Solution/EditSession/ChangeSet/CapabilityGap/Arena + protocol, events,
  typed errors.
- T0.4 package ownership map (frozen write surfaces): W1A =
  `packages/shared/src/you/**` (except TL-frozen `contract.ts`) +
  `packages/services/src/you/**`; W1B = `packages/ui/src/you/**` +
  disclosed registration-only seams in `app-shell`/`v4`; W1C =
  `packages/you-lab/**` (new isolated package). Pinned in
  `docs/you/WORK_ORDERS.md`.
- T0.5 dependency policy: zero new dependencies in wave 1; workers may not
  touch root manifests/lockfiles; TL serializes root reconciliation at T1
  (root typecheck list registration for `you-lab` included).
- T0.6 deterministic fixture strategy: `docs/you/FIXTURES.md` (added to the
  authority chain).
- T0.7 acceptance suite skeleton: `docs/you/OPERATOR_ACCEPTANCE.md` confirmed
  as the Phase-0 gate spec; each W1 order carries its acceptance slice as
  tests (node:test); the integrated acceptance battery assembles at T1.
- First gate confirmed: **Solution Runtime / Operator Review** (Phase-0 stop
  condition unchanged).

## W1 dispatch record

- Base SHA for W1A/W1B/W1C: `ff26821fec5bf42c506d47ef97d76fc2b6ca1f1b`
  (the T0 merge commit on `main`; branches cut from it by the TL).
- Tests: node:test, executed by the station (`pnpm exec tsx --test`);
  station verification battery: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`,
  `pnpm architecture:check -- --changed`, package tests.
- No CI workflow exists in this repository yet; the TL station is the
  verification authority for wave 1 (recorded as a deviation; CI
  introduction is a TL-owned follow-up).

## W1 merge records (TL station)

### W1A — Core Solution Authority (MERGED)
- PR #6 -> merge 55e4dbd (worker commit 8a5959c on `you/w1a-core`, base 8902c40).
- Station verification 2026-10-07: install exit 0; tsc -b green (rpc/provider/provider_node/shared + services/client/server/zcode-server-cli chunks; ui/web/desktop base-identical, verified green on tree); lint 0 errors / 70 warnings = exact baseline; tests 112/112.
- Evidence: worker report (in-replay session w1a, chat f6e807ff) archived at the TL station; PR #6 body carries the gate table.
- Deviations accepted: service split (oxlint max-lines), test-discovery index.ts files, cross-package relative imports, Phase-0 local types (candidates for W5A/W6A freeze).

### W1B — Solution Studio (MERGED)
- PR #7 -> merge 71269f4 (worker commit cff66d4 on `you/w1b-studio`, base 8902c40).
- Station verification 2026-10-07: install exit 0; tsc -b green incl. packages/ui; web + desktop host green; lint 0 errors / 70 warnings = exact baseline; tests 30/30.
- Seam arbitration (TL RULING): the 5 disclosed registration files outside app-shell/v4 (lib/workspaceSidePane.ts, hooks/useAppPanels.ts, App.tsx, i18n en-US/zh-CN; 63 additive lines) ACCEPTED — the pane-type union/tab-state/title catalog physically live there; the order's own example implements exactly these lines. Future order authoring pre-expands the seam list.
- Deferred to T1: bind SolutionSurfaceController to solutionService (retire simulated controller), youMessages catalog merge, operator demo UX evidence, office-mode surface policy.

## W1 — Solution Runtime / Operator Gate

## Ledger rules

The TL updates this file after each merge wave with:

- status;
- owner;
- exact branch;
- exact base SHA;
- PR number;
- commit SHA;
- tests;
- browser evidence;
- contract impact;
- security/license evidence;
- cost/latency evidence;
- deviations;
- blockers.

Workers never mark their own work DONE; they submit evidence to TL.
